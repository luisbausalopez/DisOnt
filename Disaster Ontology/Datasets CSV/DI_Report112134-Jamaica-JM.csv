1980-00003§SURGE§05§St. Mary§0509§Galina§1980/8/5§In the Rockhampton and Darlton areas all structures affected were of concrete. In Rockhampton several walls and swimming pools, which were up to 60 yards from the shoreline were demolished, windows, doors and front wall of several houses were torn away.  The sheer hydraulic force of the water did damage in most cases, but in many areas several tons of reef fragments were washed inside buildings. In one case large roof sections remained intact but were moved over 50 yards.  Three (3) other concrete buildings south of the main road suffer minor damage.  In the area of Liberty Castle 2 concrete houses were completely demolished, about five wooden structures were damaged. The east-west main road from Liberty Castle to Rockhampton was partially eroded in sections.  Pipelines, electricity and telegraphic lines were also damaged in sections. Cliff sections suffer severe erosion, several large buolders weghing tons were either washed from the sea of pushed inland from their near shore positions.  Several areas nearest to the shoreline were swept free of vegetation and soil.§Hurricane§Caused by the Atlantic Huricane Season§Geological Survey Division. (1980).
